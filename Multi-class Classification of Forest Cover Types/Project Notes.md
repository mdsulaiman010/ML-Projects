This was my final year project (FYP) focused on using the covtype dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The objective was to predict from 7 different forest cover types, for trees from the Roosevelt National Forest, with
high performance.

The challenge of using this dataset was the severe label imbalance, high dimensionality, and long training times due to 
high number of observations. The chosen metric was F1-macro scoring to properly account for observing performance while 
using the dataset's natural label imbalance.

The final
